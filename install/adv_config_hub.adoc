[#advanced-config-hub]
= MultiClusterHub advanced configuration 

{product-title} is installed using an operator that deploys all of the required components. {product-title-short} can be further configured during or after installation by adding one or more of the following attributes to the MultiClusterHub custom resource:

[#custom-image-pull-secret]
== Custom Image Pull Secret

If you plan to import Kubernetes clusters that were not created by {ocp-short} or {product-title-short}, generate a secret that contains your {ocp-short} pull secret information to access the entitled content from the distribution registry. 

The secret requirements for {ocp-short} clusters are automatically resolved by {ocp-short} and {product-title-short}, so you do not have to create the secret if you are not importing other types of Kubernetes clusters to be managed. Your {ocp-short} pull secret is associated with your Red Hat Customer Portal ID, and is the same across all Kubernetes providers.

*Important:* These secrets are namespace-specific, so make sure that you are in the namespace that you use for your hub cluster.

. Go to https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret] to download the {ocp-short} pull secret file.
. Click *Download pull secret*.
. Run the following command to create your secret:
+
----
oc create secret generic <secret> -n <namespace> --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path-to-pull-secret> --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
 - Replace `secret` with the name of the secret that you want to create.
 - Replace `namespace` with your project namespace, as the secrets are namespace-specific.
 - Replace `path-to-pull-secret` with the path to your {ocp-short} pull secret that you downloaded.

The following examples shows the template that use your custom pull secret. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace. Replace `secret` with the name of your pull secret:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
----

[#availability-config]
== availabilityConfig

The {product-title-short} hub cluster has two availabilities: `High` and `Basic`. By default, the hub cluster has an availability of `High`, which gives hub cluster components a `replicaCount` of `2`. This provides better support in cases of failover but consumes more resources that the `Basic` availability, which gives components a `replicaCount` of `1`.

The following examples shows the template with `Basic` availability. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  availabilityConfig: "Basic"
----

[#disable-hub-self-management]
== disableHubSelfManagement

By default, the {product-title-short} hub cluster is automatically imported and managed by itself as the `local-cluster`. If you do not want the {product-title-short} hub cluster to manage itself, then change the setting for `disableHubSelfManagement` from `false` to `true`. If the setting is not included in the YAML file that defines the custom resource, add it.

The following example shows the default template to use if you want to disable the hub cluster self-management feature. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  disableHubSelfManagement: true
----

[#disable-update-cluster-image-sets]
== disableUpdateClusterImageSets

If want to ensure that you use the same release image for all of your clusters, you can create your own custom list of release images that are available when creating a cluster. See the following instructions in link:../clusters/rel_img_conon.adoc#maintaining-a-custom-list-of-release-images-when-connected[Maintaining a custom list of release images when connected] to manage your available release images and to set the `disableUpdateClusterImageSets` attribute, which stops the custom image list from being overwritten.

The following example shows the default template that disable updates to the cluster image set. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  disableUpdateClusterImageSets: true
----

[#custom-ca-configmap]
== customCAConfigmap

By default, {ocp} uses the Ingress Operator to create an internal CA. 

The following example shows the default template used to provide a customized {ocp-short} default ingress CA certificate to {product-title-short}. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace. Replace `configmap` with the name of your `ConfigMap`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  customCAConfigmap: <configmap>
----

[#enable-cluster-proxy-addon]
== enableClusterProxyAddon (Technical Preview)

ClusterProxyAddon is a component. 
//description

The following example shows the default template used to enable `ClusterProxyAddon`. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  enableClusterProxyAddon: true
----

[#ssl-ciphers]
== sslCiphers

By default, the {product-title-short} hub cluster includes the full list of supported SSL ciphers. 

The following example shows the default template that is used to list `sslCiphers` for the management ingress. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  ingress:
    sslCiphers:
    - "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256"
    - "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256"
